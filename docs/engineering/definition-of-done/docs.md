# Definition of Done: Docs

A documentation change is done only when:

- The documentation is accurate for the current project behavior.
- The intended audience is clear: users, developers, operators, reviewers, or AI agents.
- The changed document has a clear purpose.
- Links and references are valid.
- Examples, commands, paths, and configuration snippets are checked when practical.
- Terminology is consistent with the rest of the project.
- Outdated or conflicting information is removed or updated.
- No product code, tests, or infrastructure behavior is changed unless the task is reclassified from `docs` to another task type.
- The merge/pull request explains what documentation changed and why.

AI-flow temporary work-item artifacts are required for docs changes that change project policy, architecture documentation, onboarding, or agent instructions when the AI development flow is used. Completed artifact directories are not required to remain committed unless the task explicitly asks to retain them.

## Blocking review conditions

The merge/pull request must not be approved until these issues are resolved:

- Any code, test, infrastructure, CI, or configuration file was changed as part of a `docs` task.
- The task should be reclassified to another task type because it changes system behavior or delivery configuration.
